<h2>Currently building this website.</h2>
<p>
	This is the future home of all my endeavors to research, organize, and publicize work related to anything of telepathic nature.  This is an ongoing project, and there will no doubt be many changes around here as I gain new understanding and skills along the way.  However, this project will remain as open as safely possible with all of its history preserved for authenticity.
</p>
<p>
	There may be a few bugs present after this last update, as rails tests have spontaneously broken everywhere, while rake tests and Guard still read green across the board.  There are more tests inbound and needed for stability, however the bulk of the backend is nearing completion and things should start picking up speed from here.

	More things on the way.  Check out the
